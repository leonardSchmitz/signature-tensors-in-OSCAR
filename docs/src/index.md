# SignatureTensors.jl

**SignatureTensors.jl** is a Julia package for computing and manipulating signature tensors of paths and membranes, built on top of the [OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org) computer algebra system.

> **Version:** 0.1 — No support is guaranteed.

## Overview

Path signatures are fundamental objects in rough path theory that capture the essential geometry of sequential data. This package provides a general algebraic framework for computing truncated signatures and working with them symbolically, leveraging the full power of OSCAR's ring arithmetic, Gröbner bases, and Lie theory.

The package supports:

- **Path signatures** — iterated-integrals signatures of piecewise linear, polynomial, spline, axis, and monomial paths over arbitrary OSCAR rings.
- **Membrane signatures** — two-parameter (id-)signatures of piecewise bilinear and polynomial membranes, extending the one-parameter theory.
- **Tensor learning** — recovery of paths from their signature tensors via polynomial systems and Gröbner bases, including the efficient algorithm from [schmitz2025efficientalgorithmtensorlearning](@cite).
- **Lie group barycenters** — computation of Fréchet means on the free nilpotent Lie group $G_{d,k}$, with several algorithm options including BCH-based and polynomial map approaches.
- **Algebraic operations** — group multiplication, inverse, logarithm, exponential, and graded projections on truncated tensor algebra elements.

All constructions work over arbitrary OSCAR rings, making them compatible with symbolic computation over $\mathbb{Q}$, polynomial rings, rational function fields, and more.

## Quick Start

```julia
using Oscar, SignatureTensors

# Define a truncated tensor algebra: dimension d=2, truncation level k=3
d, k = 2, 3
T = TruncatedTensorAlgebra(QQ, d, k)

# Signature of the canonical axis path
C=sig(T, :axis)

# Signature of a polynomial path t ↦ (t + 2t², 3t + 4t²)
S=sig(T, :pwln, coef = QQ.([1 2; 3 4]))

# Path recovery from a signature tensor
recover(S,C=C)
```
